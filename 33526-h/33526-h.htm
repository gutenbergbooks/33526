<h3>NO. XIV.&mdash;THE LADY FROM CLOUDLAND.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:450px;"><a href="images/301-900.png"><img src="images/301-450.png" width="450" height="428" alt="" /></a></div>

<p><span class="sc">At</span> intervals of a few years the torpor of London Society is stirred
by the carefully disseminated intelligence that a new planet has
begun to twinkle in the firmament of fashion, and the telescopes of
all those who are in search of novelty are immediately directed to
the spot. Partially dropping metaphor, it may be stated that a
hitherto unknown lady emerges, like the planet, from a cloud under
which, as the envious afterwards declare, the greater part of her
previous existence has been spent. But Society, under the influence
of boredom, is tolerant of new sensations and of those who seek to
provide them. Those who guard its portals are, in these latter days,
bidden not to be over-curious in the inquiries they make of applicants
for admission, and eventually it may come to pass that the
approaches and avenues are opened as readily to one who comes
trailing clouds of obscurity, as to her
who shines with the steady lustre of
acknowledged position.</p>

<p>The Lady from Cloudland soars
into the ken of fashion in various
places. Very often she is found for
the first time in the little mock
temple which pious worshippers at
the shrine of rank build for themselves
on the Riviera. They have
their ceremonial closely copied from
the London model. They dance, they
receive, they organise bazaars. They
launch out into tea-parties, and grow
warm over the discussion of scandals.
They elect unto themselves leaders,
and bow their foreheads to the dust
before the golden splendour of an
occasional scion of Royalty; in short,
they cling as closely as foreign skies
and foreign associations permit to the
observances which have made English
Society pre-eminent in its own respect,
and in the good-natured ridicule of
less-favoured nations. But since the
majority of them have come in search
of health, they cannot despise or
reject one who qualifies for consideration
and interest by suffering, and
who, to the piquancy of an unknown origin, adds the high recommendation
of good looks&mdash;which are not too good&mdash;of a cheerful
temper, and an easy tact, which can only come of much knowledge
of many worlds. Such a one is the Lady from Cloudland. Many
are the questions asked about her, and even more various are the
answers given. "My dear," one lady will say to another, at the
house of a common friend, where the Lady from Cloudland has
become the centre of a throng of admirers, "I hear, on the very best
authority, that her mother used to sell flowers in the City, and that
she herself was for some years a Circus Rider in America. Whenever
I meet her I feel a dreadful inclination to say <i>Houp-là!</i>, instead
of, How do you do?" To which her friend will reply that she, on
her side, has been informed that the lady in question was formerly
attached to the conjugal tribe of an Indian Rajah, and was rescued
by a Russian, whom she shortly afterwards poisoned. They will then
both invite her to their next entertainments, asking her by no means
to forget those delightful Burmese love-ditties which only she can
sing as they ought to be sung.</p>

<p>The Lady from Cloudland, however, does not limit her ambition
to the hybrid Society of the South of France. She intends to make
for herself a position in London, the Mecca of the aspirant, and she
proposes to use those who thus console themselves with spitefulness
as stepping-stones for the attainment of her object. At the beginning
of the following London Season Society will learn, by means of
the usual paragraphs, that "Mrs. So-and-So, whose afternoon party
last year in honour of Prince &mdash;&mdash; was one of the most brilliant
successes of a brilliant Riviera Season, has taken the house in May
Fair, formerly occupied by Lord <span class="sc">Clanracket</span>." The reiteration of
this news in many journals will set tongues wagging in London.
Again the same questions will be asked, and different answers will
be returned. In due course she arrives, she receives and is received,
and she conquers. Henceforward her parties become one of the
features of the Season. In rooms arranged tastefully in an Oriental
style, with curtains, hangings, delicately worked embroideries,
woven mats of charming design and tropical plants, she welcomes
the throng who come at her invitation. She moves by degrees.
Contenting herself at first with a small <i>chargé d'affaires</i> or a Corean
plenipotentiary, she soon rises to a fully fledged Ambassador and a
bevy of secretaries and <i>attachés</i>. Her triumph culminates when she
secures a deposed monarch and his consort. She is clever, and knows
well that those whom she seeks to entice will overlook their own
ignorance with regard to her if only they can be certain of being
amused and interested in her house. She, therefore, contrives, without
transgressing the higher <i>convenances</i>, to banish all ceremonial
stiffness from her parties, and to import in its place an atmosphere
of cheerful gaiety and musical refinement. For, whatever she may
have once been, there can be no doubt that when London makes her
acquaintance she possesses, not only charming manners, but innumerable
accomplishments which are as salt to the jaded palate of
Society people. Thus she progresses from season to season, and from
success to success.</p>

<p>In her second year she becomes a favoured guest in many country
houses, where an effort is made to relieve the tedium of daily shooting
parties by nightly frivolities. Soon afterwards she is presented
at Court, and becomes herself a patroness to many foreigners who
desire by the exercise of their talents to make a precarious living in
England. By these she is considered to be one of the suns from
which the great world draws its light
and warmth. In her third Season
she is sufficiently secure to introduce
into Society her daughter, aged
eighteen, who has hitherto (so she
will inform her friends) been receiving
a good education abroad. Accompanied
by "my little girl," she may
be seen, on fine afternoons, reclining
in her spick and span Victoria, in the
midst of the crowd in the Ladies'
Mile. She is thus hedged round with
a respectability which not even indiscreet
inquiries after her late husband
(for it is understood that he
died and left her in comfort many
years before) can disturb. She permits
herself occasionally, it is true,
to join <i>chic</i> parties at fashionable
restaurants, but these, since they are
often under titled patronage, can
scarcely be considered serious lapses
from propriety. After having herself
presented her daughter at Court, and
having given (in London) a party
which was attended by Royalty, she
is beyond the reach of cavil or
reproach. Here and there a jealous
and disappointed social rival may
still mutter dark hints about ancient vagaries, and meaning looks
may still be exchanged by male and female gossips, but for the
great mass of those who frequent Society she is as irreproachable
as though her ancestry for twenty generations had been set
down in the pages of <i>Burke</i> or <i>Debrett</i>. Eventually she marries
her daughter to the younger son of an Earl, and having made of the
marriage festivities <i>the</i> great social function of the Season, she herself
soon afterwards retires to some extent from the business of Society,
and devotes herself chiefly to the cultivation of simple pleasures and
hot-house flowers in a luxurious retreat on the banks of the Thames.</p>

<h3>DIANA AT DINNER.</h3>

<blockquote><p>
[On the first page of the prospectus of the recently-established
"Dorothy" Restaurant it is stated that it is for "Ladies only."
On the last page will be found the following modification:&mdash;"At
the request of many of the Lady customers, it has been decided
to open the Restaurant from 6·30 <span class="sc">P.M.</span> to 10 <span class="sc">P.M.</span> to both Ladies
and Gentlemen."]
</p></blockquote>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p><span class="sc">There</span> was started in London, I mustn't say where,</p>
<p class="i2">And, beyond saying lately, I mustn't say when,</p>
<p>A sweet Restaurant, where the sex that is fair</p>
<p class="i2">Might attend undisturbed by the presence of men.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"We are forced to endure you in Park and in Row,</p>
<p class="i2">We must bear you unwilling in hansom or 'bus;</p>
<p>But if any stray <i>here</i>, they shall meet with a No,&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">So attempt not the haunt that is sacred to Us.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"Be warned, O intruder, nor venture to lag</p>
<p class="i2">When the nymphs of Diana the huntress draw nigh.</p>
<p>Fly, fly from their presence as fleet as a stag.</p>
<p class="i2">Lest you meet with the fate of Actæon, and die."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Thus the Ladies addressed us; the tables were set,</p>
<p class="i2">The silver was polished, the viands displayed.</p>
<p>And, like doves in a dove-cote, the customers met,</p>
<p class="i2">In a plumage of silks and of muslins arrayed.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"This is sweet!" said <span class="sc">Amanda</span>. "Delightful!" said <span class="sc">Jane</span>.</p>
<p class="i2">While the rest in a chorus of "Charming!" combined.</p>
<p>And, declaring they cared not if dishes were plain,</p>
<p class="i2">So the men remained absent, they solemnly dined.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And they toyed with their <i>entrées</i>, and sipped their Clicquot,</p>
<p class="i2">And their smiles were as sweet as the wine that they drank.</p>
<p>But at last came a whisper&mdash;"Oh dear, this is slow!"</p>
<p class="i2">"Hush, hush!" said the others. "How dreadfully frank!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"Not slow; but there's something&mdash;I scarcely know what,</p>
<p class="i2">An absence, a dulness I cannot define.</p>
<p>It may be the soup, which was not very hot,</p>
<p class="i2">Or the roast, or the waiting, the ice, or the wine.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"But I'm sure there's a something." And so they agreed,</p>
<p class="i2">And they formed a Committee to talk of the case.</p>
<p>And a programme was issued for all men to read,</p>
<p class="i2">Bidding men (on page one) to abstain from the place.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>But, since it is harder to ban than to bless,</p>
<p class="i2">"For their own sakes," they said, "we will humour the men."</p>
<p>If you turn to the last page, you'll find this P.S.:&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">"Men allowed, by desire, from 6·30 to 10."</p>

<h2>WEEK BY WEEK.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">In</span> the course of last week it was universally remarked that the
<i>beau monde</i> betook itself by the usual methods of conveyance to
Ascot. A very smartly-appointed coach, horsed entirely by blue-black
hippogriffs, attracted much attention. The lunches were of
more than ordinary magnificence, and it was calculated that, during
the week, no less than 5,624,907 bottles of champagne were consumed.
The pigeon-pies were, as usual, composed mostly of beef.</p>

<hr />

<p>One charming toilette was the cynosure of neighbouring eyes in
the Enclosure. It was constructed of four gold <i>galons</i>, tastefully
distributed on a blue silk ground intended to represent the Lake of
Geneva. This was fringed with <i>passementerie</i> of the most ancient
design, and picked out with minute red spots arranged in geometrical
figures. The bonnet was composed of a single scrap of antique lace
folded over a threepenny bit.</p>

<hr />

<p>H.R.H. the Grand Duke of <span class="sc">Katzenjammer</span>, who is making a stay
of several weeks in the Metropolis, in order that he may study free
institutions on the spot, has been, we are informed, busily engaged
in writing and answering letters during the past three days.</p>

<hr />

<p>An interesting story, of which His Royal Highness is the hero, is
going the round of the Clubs. It appears that on his arrival at the
hotel in which he has established himself with his suite, the Grand
Duke, whose absence of mind is well known, forgot to remunerate
the cabman who had driven him. This individual, however, with
the rudeness which is still, we regret to say, characteristic of the
lower orders of our fellow countrymen, made repeated applications
for his money, and eventually threatened to call in a policeman or to
take out a summons. On this becoming known to the Grand Duke,
he at once gave orders that the cabman should be ushered into his
presence, and, after presenting him with a paper gulden, invested
him then and there with the order of the Golden Ball, at the same
time exclaiming that honesty and perseverance in humble life were
always worthy of commendation. The cabman is said to have been
much moved. In these democratic days, such instances of princely
condescension are not without value.</p>

<hr />

<p>We are requested by the Earl of <span class="sc">C-v-ntr-y</span> to state that he is sick
to death of the whole business, and has eliminated the word "enclosure"
from every dictionary he has been able to lay his hands on. He
had intended at first to admit nobody, but was overruled, and he cannot,
therefore, hold himself responsible for the presence of various
people who seemed to think that they ought to be treated like unseasonable
strawberries, first forced, then exhibited, and then swallowed.</p>

<hr />

<p>An amusing incident is reported from the remote frontier village of
Pusterwitz in Moldavia. A cobbler who had manufactured the boots
of the Burgomaster ventured to submit his bill for payment. The
populace, infuriated by this insult to their beloved Magistrate, after
binding the offender in calf at the local publishing office, proceeded
to slice him into small pieces with their <i>schneide-messers</i> (the native
knife), to the immense delight of a crowd of peasants from the
surrounding districts. The Burgomaster was much touched by this
proof of popular devotion.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/double_rule-1.png" width="250" height="10" alt="double-rule" border="0" /></div>

<p><span class="sc">Going Too Fast.</span>&mdash;M. <span class="sc">Alexandre Jacques</span>, who is announced as "a
rival to <span class="sc">Succi</span>," is at this moment dispensing with food at the Royal
Aquarium. He intends carrying out this self-denying programme for
two days beyond a couple of score&mdash;possibly as a proof of his fortitude
or (as a Cockney would pronounce the word) "forty-two'd." The last
time this talented person dispensed with sustenance, was in Edinburgh,
when he did not partake of any meal in the Douglas Hotel for thirty
days&mdash;a feat, one would think, that must have been more interesting
to the Medical Profession than the proprietor of the hostelry. However,
as M. <span class="sc">Jacques</span> fought for his country in 1870-71, he should be a most
pleasant guest for the next six weeks or so to dinner-givers with a
taste for economy.</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, June 16.</i>&mdash;"This is something like
old times," said <span class="sc">Tim Healy</span>, briskly rubbing his hands. "Poor
<span class="sc">Joseph Gillis</span>! pity he didn't live to see this night."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;"><a href="images/304a-480.png"><img src="images/304a-150.png" width="150" height="263" alt="At Bay." /></a>
<p class="center">At Bay.</p></div>

<p>Very like old times, indeed. Seventy questions on the paper,
increased fourfold by others put arising out of the answer. Practice
is for Irish Members to put question; Prince <span class="sc">Arthur</span> reads answer
from manuscript supplied from Irish
Office; then uprise in succession
half-a-dozen other Irish Members,
each asking fresh question. Prince
<span class="sc">Arthur</span> with one leg crossed over
other and hand to chin sits looking
and listening; presently when there
is lull, lounges up to table and
makes answer. <span class="sc">Fergusson</span> looks on
in wonder. "What would become
of me," he said, "supposing after
I had read out my cut-and-dried
answer, half-a-dozen fellows sprang
on my back, and with fists in my
face demanded reply to quite new
question. I'm afraid I'd be lost."</p>

<p>That exceedingly probable. <span class="sc">Fergusson's</span>
floundering when momentarily
adrift from sheet-anchor of
his written reply decidedly painful.
Prince <span class="sc">Arthur</span> saunters up to very
mouth of guns of battery opened on
him from Irish camp; looks straight
down them; fires his shot; and
saunters back; often a nasty shot,
too; plumps in middle of camp and
sets them all a roaring. This takes
place every night. To-night lasted
an hour. Once threatened repetition of scenes of decade after '74.
Would have so happened but for tact and presence of mind of
<span class="sc">Speaker</span>; cool and collected amid the clash of arms and roar of
constant cannonading. <span class="sc">John Dillon</span> standing with folded arms
and flashing eyes, "Like <span class="sc">Napoleon</span> when he couldn't cross the
Alps," said <span class="sc">Nicholas Wood</span>, looking on from a safe distance.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">Speaker</span> also on his feet with stern cry of "Order! Order!"
Long <span class="sc">John O'Connor</span> sitting on Bench below, darting straight up
and down, with swift regular movement, for all the world like the
piston of a steam-engine. Ministerialists bellowing in continuous
roar at <span class="sc">John Dillon</span>, still on his feet; uprises <span class="sc">John O'Connor</span>
with
intent to offer observation; roar redoubled; reaches demoniac proportions;
<span class="sc">John O'Connor</span> plops down again; noise partially subsides;
suddenly the piston discovered bolt upright; another roar; down it
goes; all the while the <span class="sc">Speaker</span> crying aloud for "Order!" and
<span class="sc">John Dillon</span> standing with fiercer frown and arms more tightly
folded.</p>

<p>"What was it <span class="sc">Napoleon</span> said when he couldn't cross the Alps?"
<span class="sc">Nicholas</span> whispered, tremulously. "'If the Alps won't come to
<span class="sc">Mahomet</span>, <span class="sc">Mahomet</span> must go to the Alps.' No, I don't think it
was
quite that; but was something to that effect; and I'm sure something
will happen if <span class="sc">Dillon</span> doesn't sit down."</p>

<p>Just when matters reaching crisis, <span class="sc">Dillon</span> gave way; the piston
on the bench below simultaneously ceased its action; and the
<span class="sc">Speaker</span>, in quiet, grave tones, that had immediately soothing effect,
suggested that, if any more information was required, it should be
sought in the usual way, by Questions placed on the Paper. <span class="sc">Johnston</span>
o' Ballykilbeg, who had overheard <span class="sc">Gill</span> incidentally allude to
Prince <span class="sc">Arthur</span> as prone to untruth, wanted the <span class="sc">Speaker</span> to take
notice of irregularity. But <span class="sc">Speaker</span> judiciously deaf. As for <span class="sc">John
O'Connor</span>, glad of a little rest.</p>

<p>"All I wanted, <span class="sc">Toby</span>," he explained, "was to hurl the word
'Crime' in <span class="sc">Balfour's</span> teeth."</p>

<p>"Exactly," I said; "nothing more natural or desirable. But
you should tone down the tendency towards the steam-engine-piston
action, for which, I do not deny, you possess some natural advantages."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;In Committee on Compensation Bill.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;"What's this I hear about Heligoland?" says
<span class="sc">Nicholas Wood</span>. Hardly knew him; so changed. A dull, heavy
look faded over his usually mobile countenance; his svelte figure
puffed out, and bent. "Only fortnight ago, <span class="sc">Sage of Queen
Anne's Gate</span> proposed to give up Heligoland; barter it for a case of
German Sausages, says he. <span class="sc">Fergusson</span> very properly angry; me
and other good Tories protested against this new Separatist policy.
Couldn't find Heligoland on the map."</p>

<p>"Ha!" I say, "but Germany has found it, and taken it, and the
<span class="sc">Markiss</span> is willin'."</p>

<p>"Very odd," says <span class="sc">Nicholas</span>; "can't make it out; like a thing
out of a play; never go to a play, you know, but understand this
sort of thing is somehow done: first you see it, then you don't;
Heligoland British territory; to be sacrificed only with last drop of
blood; Radical Separatists rapped on knuckles for suggesting handing
over; then we wake up, and find it's been handed over, and by
the <span class="sc">Markiss</span>! Tell you what it is, <span class="sc">Toby</span>, think I shall cut this
business; not brought up to politics; find them a little weakening."</p>

<p class="center">The Ladies' Man.</p></div>

<p><span class="sc">Old Morality</span> announced programme for remainder of Session.
In bulk something exceeding ordinary
programme when brought in in February.
Now it is the so-called June; every
prospect of sitting till October; House
groans and growls; terrible charges
flying round; <span class="sc">Winterbotham</span> darkly
accuses Cabinet Minister of keeping a
public-house. <span class="sc">Hicks-Beach</span> admits soft
impeachment, but pleads it's "only a
little one, brings me in only £20 a-year
rent." "Miserable!" says <span class="sc">Newnes</span>,
who owns <i>Tit Bits</i>.</p>

<p>General feeling of sympathy with
<span class="sc">Beach</span>. <span class="sc">Winterbotham</span> apologises; if
he'd known it was only £20 wouldn't
have said anything. <span class="sc">Old Morality</span>, in
his kind way, presses <span class="sc">Beach's</span> hand; has
troubles of his own to bear; but a man
who owns a public-house and draws only
£20 a-year from it, takes precedence in
sympathy.</p>

<p>Over stern conflict and cantankerous
sitting, <span class="sc">Plunket</span> sheds beam of genial
humour. <span class="sc">Tim Healy</span> asks if there could
not be lift arranged to Ladies' Gallery.
"Too expensive," says <span class="sc">Plunket</span>. "Too
dear, he means," murmurs <span class="sc">Howorth</span>,
who runs <span class="sc">Dick Temple</span> close in his
devotion to the Ladies. "Why," objects
<span class="sc">George Campbell</span>, whose eye nothing
escapes, "there is already a lift for coal.
Why not substitute Ladies for coal?"</p>

<p>"You see," said <span class="sc">Plunket</span>, smilingly, "we cannot do either
without coal or without Ladies, and it is difficult to combine them in
a lift."</p>

<p><span class="sc">George Campbell</span> not sure. When he has time to withdraw his
thoughts from Central Asia, will look into the matter.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;In Committee on Compensation Bill. Ministerial
majority reduced to 29.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;"I really can't do it," said <span class="sc">Maclure</span>. "Oh, you
must," said <span class="sc">Chaplin</span>; "hard work,
I know, but put on a spurt and
there you are."</p>

<p>"Wish I <i>was</i> there," said <span class="sc">Maclure</span>,
mopping his forehead. "All
very well for slim young thing like
you; but seventeen stun isn't the
form for a short spin, especially
with these confounded steps." Scene&mdash;passage
by Cloak-room into House
of Commons; time 5·19 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>; bell
ringing furiously; Division imminent;
<span class="sc">Penrose Fitzgerald</span> with
jacket shorter than ever, trousers
turned up with a grace that maddens
with envy. <span class="sc">Bobby Spencer</span> and
<span class="sc">Lewisham</span>, on watch at top of
staircase.</p>

<p>"Come along!" he shouts; "dividing
on First Clause of Compensation
Bill; <span class="sc">Sage of Queen Anne's
Gate</span> sprung a mine on us; got all
their men here; ours down at Ascot;
wouldn't be you for a quarter's
salary, <span class="sc">Chaplin</span>. Hurry up! hurry
up! Put your best leg forward,
<span class="sc">Maclure</span>!"</p>

<p>"That's all very well," said
<span class="sc">Maclure</span>, testily; "but which <i>is</i>
my best leg?"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:150px;"><a href="images/304c-480.png"><img src="images/304c-150.png" width="150" height="301" alt="On Outpost Duty." /></a>
<p class="center">On Outpost Duty.</p></div>

<p>The two heavy-weights pounded
gallantly along; been to Ascot;
thought they'd be back in plenty of time for Division; and here's
Division-bell at its last shake. <span class="sc">Hartington</span> come up with them;
striding ahead; wins easily; <span class="sc">Chaplin</span> reaches door of House just as
it is closing; with tremendous effort, <span class="sc">Maclure</span> pulls himself
together; throws himself on doorway; nothing could stand rush like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>[pg 305]</span>
that; door bursts open; <span class="sc">Maclure</span> and Compensation Bill saved.
A very close shave. When Division taken, 228 vote for Government,
224 against; majority Four&mdash;the four who raced up the
staircase hot from Ascot.</p>

<p>Crowded House in wild excitement. <span class="sc">Sage of Queen Anne's Gate</span>
consumed in bitterness of spirit. "If we'd divided half an hour ago
we should have had majority of 25; a quarter of an hour ago, ten
minutes ago, five minutes ago, sixty seconds earlier, we'd have won.
But those Irish Shylocks must have their pound of verbosity.
Couldn't resist temptation of putting an extra question, even for certainty
of defeating Government. When they're once started on
subject of shadowing, they go off by the hour."</p>

<p>"Well, never mind," said <span class="sc">Gorst</span>; "you know it isn't the first
time in history that men have sacrificed the substance for the shadow."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;The Government's&mdash;very nearly.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Home Secretary</span> in the Dock; Sir <span class="sc">William
Harcourt</span>,
Q.C., instructed by Mr. <span class="sc">Henry Fowler</span> (Messrs. <span class="sc">Corser,
Fowler, &amp; Langley</span>, Wolverhampton), prosecuted. Prisoner, who
was accommodated with a seat, conducted his own defence. After
long consultation, Jury could not agree, and were discharged without
a verdict.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Metropolitan Police Vote agreed to.</p>

<h3>THE OPERA-GOER'S DIARY.</h3>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;<i>Carmen.</i> <span class="sc">Zélie</span> is the accepted <i>Carmen</i> this
season&mdash;no
better; and <span class="sc">Maggie Macintyre</span> as <i>Michaela</i>, which, being an
awkward name to pronounce, might be abbreviated to <i>Mickie</i>. <span class="sc">Dan
Drady</span> the Dramatic, excellent as <i>Escamillo</i>. One singer in a season
plays many parts, and one part is played by
several singers. How would a theatre succeed
conducted on this plan, so that the same play
should be produced on certain nights with a different
cast? Here is <span class="sc">Dan Drady</span>, for example;
he plays <i>Escamillo</i>, tragi-comedy, one night;
another time he is the noble <i>San Bris</i> in <i>Les
Huguenots</i>; another, he is <i>Figaro</i> the loquacious
<i>Barber of Seville</i>; another, he is the
devil-may-care gallant <i>Don Giovanni</i>; and,
though best in serious parts, he is good in all
of them. On other occasions, when <i>Carmen</i>
is given, the cast will be changed; some other
singer will represent <i>Escamillo</i>, or someone
will replace <span class="sc">Maggie</span> as <i>Mickie</i>; <span class="sc">Ravelli</span> the
Reliable will have been <i>Don José</i> once, and
then <span class="sc">Montariol</span> or <span class="sc">Ybos</span> (why Boss? Can't
yet make this out), or even <span class="sc">Jean de Reszké</span>
may represent the nincompoop soldier. Suppose <i>A Pair of Spectacles</i>,
with a change of cast, Mr. <span class="sc">Hare</span> out of it occasionally, and
Mr. ... Ah! there's the difficulty, Mr. Who, taking his part.
Imagine <i>Faust</i> without <span class="sc">Irving</span> as <i>Mephistopheles</i>. What a
big Company it would require! No; better leave well alone.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:150px;"><a href="images/305-325.png"><img src="images/305-150.png" width="150" height="254" alt="Mr Punch at the Opera." /></a></div>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;<i>Faust.</i> Always a safe draw. Same cast as before.
Worth noting, that <span class="sc">Gounod</span> has given <i>Wagner</i> very little to do in
this
Opera, and that little not of his best. Evidently <span class="sc">Gounod</span> does not
possess a strong sense of humour, or he wouldn't have lost such a
chance as this. In the Kermesse Scene <i>Wagner</i> should have commenced
one of his own Wagnerian strains, in the Wagnerian style,
and been immediately stopped by the student's applause.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;<i>Le Nozze di Figaro.</i> Always charming. Should
like to see examination paper on the plot of <i>Le Nozze</i>, questions to
be answered without any reference to book.</p>

<blockquote><p>
1. Give succinct and clear account of the plot.</p>

<p>2. What connection with plot have <i>Figaro's</i> father and mother?</p>

<p>3. What social position among the Count's guests are the ladies of
the ballet supposed to hold?</p>

<p>4. Having stated this, account for their costumes.</p>

<p>5. Why does Mlle. <span class="sc">Palladino</span>, the chief dancing guest, take no
sort of notice of <i>Il Conte</i> and <i>La Contessa</i>? Are they not on
speaking terms? If not, why not?</p>

<p>6. Why is <i>Don Bartolo</i> always made up and costumed as a
superior Pantaloon?
</p></blockquote>

<p>Delighted again to see <span class="sc">Ella Russell</span> as <i>Susanna</i>. To think that
only the other evening she was the graceful and stately <i>Queen
Marguerite</i> in <i>Les Huguenots</i>, and now she is a <i>soubrette très
piquante</i>.
There are other pages in Madame <span class="sc">Scalchi's</span> history&mdash;the page in <i>the
Huguenots</i>, for example, and his twin brother in <i>Lucrezia
Borgia</i>&mdash;which
like me more than her <i>Cherubino</i>. Vocally <span class="sc">Dan Drady</span> the
Dramatic is all right; but he is too severe for <i>Figaro</i> the barber.
Good house considering it is Ascot week, and on this night when such
sad rumours are in the air, everyone sincerely delighted at seeing the
Marchioness of <span class="sc">Lorne</span> in the Royal Box.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;<i>Cup Day</i>, Ascot. <i>Roméo et Juliette.</i> Most
appropriate:
<i>Juliette</i> takes the Cup.</p>

<p><i>Friday, Don Giovanni</i>; and <i>Saturday, Lucia</i>. This deponent
sings, "Not there, not there, my child!" "Eye hath not seen,"&mdash;I
mean, "<i>I</i> have not seen" these two on these two particular occasions;
but I believe that, in consequence of my absence, the Opera went on
as usual, and <span class="sc">Druriolanus</span> did not have to come before the Curtain
and make an apology.</p>

<h2>IN THE KNOW.</h2>

<h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Own Prophet.</i>)</h4>

<p><span class="sc">The</span> crass and pernicious dulness of some people exceeds belief.
There exists at the office of this paper a <i>person</i>&mdash;he is absolutely
unworthy of any other designation&mdash;who presumed last week to
abstain from inserting in these columns the article to which the
sporting millions of his fellow countrymen were looking for information
with reference to the Ascot doings. I have no doubt whatever
that <i>he himself used the hints</i> which that article contained, for I have
since seen him in a brand-new hat and a gold watch-chain, the result
of his ill-gotten gains. For my own sake I am forced to explain this
sinister business, lest the preposterous suet-headed Mr. J. should
triumph, and my readers should suppose for a moment that I would
willingly disappoint them. I have kept a copy of what I wrote, and
I here transcribe some of it in self-defence.</p>

<p>"With regard to the Royal Hunt Cup," I observed, "only a bat-eyed
bargee, with the brains of a molluscous monkey, could fail to
see the merits of <i>Morion</i>. <i>Morion</i>, it is well known, is an open
helmet, but it doesn't follow from that that the Hunt Cup is an open
event. Far from it. Visor, or no visor, those who elect to stand on
<i>Morion</i>, need anticipate no trouble from anything else, for <i>Morion</i>
is as certain to win the race as Mr. J. is to make a green-gooseberry
fool of himself before another week is out." There was accuracy.
No silly beating about the bush, but a straightforward piece of information,
which not even the great band of boozy Bedlamites and
buffoons who dance attendance on Mr. J. could have mistaken. But,
as I said, no blame attaches to me in the matter.</p>

<p>Now then with regard to the Gold Cup. I said: "In the Gold
Cup the old adage holds, <i>Medio tutissimus ibis</i>. The Ibis, I may
mention, though he was an Egyptian bird, cannot be termed a flyer.
However, take the three words <i>The Gold Cup</i>, select the middle word,
open your mouth, bung up the eyes of anyone who impedes you, and
wire to your Commissioner." The middle word was "Gold," and
<i>Gold</i>, of course, won the Cup that was of, <i>or</i> belonging to him. Ask
Prince <span class="sc">Soltykoff</span> if am right or wrong. And for the rest, if any
fuddling, bolus-brained, bran-faced, turnip-tongued, hippopotamus-headed
moon-calf doubts my word, let him remember that there are
pistols for two&mdash;<i>and coffee for one</i>, in Belgium, and let him tremble.</p>

<h3>THE WAY WE SHALL LIVE SOON.</h3>

<h4>(<i>From the Diary of the Automatically Conducted.</i>)</h4>

<p>7 <span class="sc">A.M.</span>&mdash;Turned out of automatically constructed bed and deposited
on the floor. Am picked up and hurled into an automatic dressing,
washing, and shaving chair, after which, being dressed by self-acting
machinery, descend by switchback lift to dining-room, where I am
fed by an "automatic private breakfast supplier" while listening to
last night's speeches in the House, and the latest gossip, furnished by
one of the "<i>Phonographic Association's Parliamentary and Social
Scandal Machines</i>."</p>

<p>10 <span class="sc">A.M.</span>&mdash;Take automatic horse exercise, and am thrown twice,
being picked up each time automatically by a self-registering and
revolving automatic policeman.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Noon.</span>&mdash;Attend the marriage of a favourite niece, assisting at the
subsequent social entertainment which is supplied to the assembled
guests on the platform of a West-End terminus from one of the
"Twopenny Wedding Breakfast Company's Automatic Machines,"
the Bridegroom at the same time presenting the Bridesmaids with a
handsome Penny Piece of Jewellery from a similar source.</p>

<p>4 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>&mdash;Hair cut automatically, but, owing to some want of nice
adjustment in the machinery, having managed to get ears clipped
smartly at the same time, put penny into slot and consult an
automatic pillar-post. Eventually get my head (and my hat too,
by mistake) strapped up by patent automatic binder in the ward of
an automatically conducted Hospital.</p>

<p>8 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>&mdash;Dine automatically with automatic halfpenny appetite,
listening to Phonographic Italian Opera at one of Metropolitan
District Underground Stations.</p>

<p>10 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>&mdash;Dragged up-stairs mechanically by switch-back lift, and
have my boots pulled off by machinery, being automatically flung
into a hot bath, turned out, scrubbed, lifted out, dried by a revolving
towel, and eventually thrown into bed and tucked up, and finally
sent to sleep by Phonograph repeating good things said by funny
man at previous day's evening-party.</p>

<h3>HARROW OR HANVER?</h3>

<p><span class="sc">From</span> an all-too-brief correspondence in
the <i>P. M. G.</i>, we learn that Mr. <span class="sc">John
Addington Symonds</span> is very angry with
Mr. <span class="sc">Frank Harris</span> for a statement appearing
in a <i>Fortnightly Review</i> article of his,
that he "went to Hanver at the age of
thirteen." Mr. <span class="sc">Symonds</span> explains that it
was to Harrow that he went at that period
of his life, and that he has never been to
Hanver at all&mdash;which, no doubt, is a matter
of great importance to mankind in general.
He complains, moreover, that his essay is
"villanously ill-edited." Surely this is what
<i>Polonius</i> would call "an ill-phrase," and
suggests a doubt whether Mr. <span class="sc">Symonds</span>
cultivated much at Harrow those "ingenuous
arts," the study of which "softens the
manners and does not permit them to be
brutal." Perhaps it is not even now too late
for him to pick them up. He might try Hanver.</p>

<h3>THE LADIES' YEAR.</h3>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Miss Margaret Alford (of Girton) Niece of scholarly Dean Alford, is
announced in one of the four "Senior Classes" at Cambridge.</i></p></blockquote>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"<span class="sc">A Dream</span> of Fair Women"&mdash;who shine in the Schools,</p>
<p>The Muse should essay ere her ardour quite cools.</p>
<p>Come, bards, take your lyres and most carefully tune 'em,</p>
<p>For Girton in glory now pairs off with Newnham.</p>
<p>Miss <span class="sc">Fawcett</span> the latter with victory wreathed,</p>
<p>And now, ere the males from their marvel are breathed,</p>
<p>Miss <span class="sc">Margaret Alford</span>, the niece of the Dean,</p>
<p>As a Classical First for the former is seen.</p>
<p>Let Girton toast Newnham, and Newnham pledge Girton,</p>
<p>And&mdash;let male competitors put a brisk "spurt" on,</p>
<p>Lest when modern Minerva adds learning to grace,</p>
<p>Young Apollo should find himself out of the race!</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width:200px;"><a href="images/309-730.png"><img src="images/309-200.png" width="200" height="253" alt="The Mephistophelian Whistlerian Butterfly 'On the pounce at Antwerp.'" /></a>
<p class="center">The Mephistophelian Whistlerian Butterfly "On the Pounce" at Antwerp.</p></div>

<p>"<i>The Gentle Art of making Enemies, as pleasantly exemplified
in many instances," &amp;c., &amp;c.</i> (for full title see the book itself) is,
whatever "<i>Messieurs les Ennemis</i>" may think of it, a work of rare
humour. Of course you must first of all be interested in King
<span class="sc">James</span> and his subjects,&mdash;his principal subject being himself,
(and lucky the man who can <i>command himself</i>)&mdash;and you must
wish to know the story of his rights and wrongs; then this interest and
desire being taken for granted, the book of the butterfly is a thing of
beauty and a joy for now and ever.
The heads are
epigrammatic and the tails sprightly, and both eminently characteristic,
for the heads tell their own tales, and the tails in tadpolian
scheme are the outcome of the heads. Most of the waggery is in
these tailpieces, which, one and all of them, represent
the real Whistlerian spirit, "the Familiar" of <span class="sc">Etcher James</span>, that is
the Demoniacal Butterfly "in various aspics," as Mrs. <span class="sc">Malaprop</span> might
say. Does the Butterfly's Master address "<i>Messieurs les Ennemis</i>,"
the Familiar Spirit is all politeness, with head down and wings outstretched
saluting before coming to "on guard." Does Master "rid
himself of the friendship of the many?"&mdash;the little Demon shakes a reef
out of his tail and flies upwards, to return after a short flight of fancy.
On occasions when Master has been reflecting comically and satirically
on some of his attackers, or on his detractors, the volatile Imp
literally shakes his sides with uncontrollable laughter, and can't
stand upright for very mirth. The famous "Ten o'clock" which
has been immortalised by <i>Mr. Punch</i> as the "Ten-and-sixpenny
o'clock," in consequence of the tickets being half-a-guinea apiece,
is here reprinted. <span class="sc">Prospero Whistler</span> packs up his bag of tricks,
buries his wand, makes his bow with a little speech at a testimonial
dinner given to him by his friends, and the Familiar Demon Butterfly,
free at last, darts into space, leaves "Finis" below,&mdash;then, you
turn over the page, all is blank,&mdash;Magician and Familiar have
vanished!</p>

<p><span class="sc">David Stott</span>, not of Oldham, but of Oxford Street, publishes
dainty little pocket volumes, and here is one yclept <i>Essays or Counsels
of Francis Bacon</i>. "Put it in the bag!" says the Baron, "and
let it be my travelling companion, so that, whenever I want refreshment
I may feed on <span class="sc">Bacon</span>, that many-sided philosopher." It is a
wonderfully handy volume, tastefully and substantially bound, and
its type of the very clearest. Much-occupied men, who can only
snatch here a moment and there a moment for reading, ought to be
grateful to the inventors and the publishers of all handy books,
meaning, says the Baron, books which are really handy, and which,
without destroying the natural elegance of your figure or the set of
your garments, you can carry comfortably and imperceptibly in your
tail coat pocket.</p>

<p><i>Notes from the News.</i> By <span class="sc">James Payn</span>. (<span class="sc">Chatto and
Windus.</span>)
Notes on passing events of all sorts, spiced with capital stories, which
will indeed be a big capital to be drawn upon by the dining-out
<i>raconteur</i>,&mdash;the only thing against his present success being that
most persons will have read these stories in <i>The Illustrated London
News</i> or in this volume. It is a book for the weary work-all-day man
to dip into, and to come out of it again refreshed. When in doubt as
to what light reading to take up, the Baron advises, "Take <span class="sc">Payn's</span>."</p>

<p class="author"><span class="sc">Baron de Book-Worms.</span></p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;My faithful "Co." has been revelling in the Summer Holiday
Number of <i>All The Year Round</i>, which consists of a complete
story entitled, <i>A Mist of Error</i>, by <span class="sc">Mary Angela Dickens</span>. The
authoress is the granddaughter of the great novelist, and the daughter
of his son, the most popular of editors, and the best of good fellows.
My "Co." reports, that the novelette is full of promise, and is a
proof that literary genius is hereditary. Interesting from the first
page to the last, <i>A Mist of Error</i>, in spite of its title, is never
suggestive of a fog. My faithful "Co." is also delighted with <i>Men
of the Time Birthday Book</i>, compiled by Mr. <span class="sc">J. F. Boyes</span>, F.S.A.&mdash;a
charming little Volume that everyone will be proud to possess.
He prophesies that it will be one of the most popular of Birthday
Books, and congratulates its compiler on the production of a work of
distinct historical value.</p>

<h3>A GREAT GUNN.</h3>

<blockquote><p>
[<span class="sc">Gunn</span>, the great Notts' Batsman, playing for the Players of England
against the Australians at Lords, on June 19 and 20, made 228 runs, the
highest individual score ever made in this country against the Australians.]
</p></blockquote>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p><span class="sc">Such</span> calm, graceful batting, of funk as defiant,</p>
<p class="i2">As proof against flurry, deserved the crowd's roar.</p>
<p>'Twas Cricket, indeed, when the Nottingham Giant,</p>
<p class="i2">Against the best batting, piled up that huge score;</p>
<p>And the crowd as they watched him smite, play, block, or run,</p>
<p class="i2">Could grasp the full meaning of "Sure as a <span class="sc">Gunn</span>!"</p>

<h3>ROBERT AT THE LEATHERSELLERS'.</h3>

<p><span class="sc">We</span> had been so preshus busy at "the Grand Hotel" lately, that
I hadn't seen werry much of my deer old Citty, but larst week I
was arsked for to go and offishyate there at the jolly Leathersellers
Company's Grand Dinner, as they was about to have a very distangy
Party including one of our most sellybrated Hartist's, who's that
poplar that ewerybody calls him <span class="sc">'Arry</span> instead of <span class="sc">'Enery</span>, as
must
in course have been the name as his godmothers and godfathers gav
him when he was quite young and had his fust taste of a cold Bath,
and most probberbly didn't like it.</p>

<p>So I went accordingly, and a werry scrumpshus Bankwet they
had, includin them trewly Royal luxeries '80 Shampane and '47
Port! Ah! what a thing it must be to be a Royal or a Nobel
persson, and to live on all the Fat of the Land, and wash it all down
with nothink yunger than '80 shampain and '47 Port! And no
matter where you gos, or weather it's to lay down a Fust Stone, or
to Hopen a Hexibishun, or to take a Chair at a nobel Charity Dinner,
there it is all reddy for you, and a hole crowd of Peeple a watching
you a eating and a drinking of 'em, and a thanking you artily for
taking the trubble of doing so! Ah! I sumtimes werrily beleeves
as that my nateral tastes tells me as I was horiginally hintended
for sum such useful life myself!</p>

<p>Well, arter the Bankwet of course we had all the reglar gushing
speeches, and werry bewtifool but rather lengthy they was, but
presently a sumthink appened as more estonished me praps than
anythink as has appened to me for some time past.</p>

<p>The hartistick and poplar Gent as ewerybody calls <span class="sc">Arry Furnace</span>
was called upon to return thanks for Hart, when to my intense
estonishment, and ewerybody else's emusement, he acshally said as
how as his frend "<span class="sc">Robert</span>," seeing how garstly pale he turned
when he was told wot he wood have to do, had writ down for him
6 lines of most bewtifool Poetry, which he at wunce proceeded to
recite, and sat down amid enthusiastick cheers and shouts of larfter!
Seeing my look of puzzled surprise, he kindly turned round to me
and said, "Look here, <span class="sc">Robert</span>, as I've rather taken a libberty with
your honnerd name, I'll repay you by taking another with your
well-known features," and borrowing a bewtifool pencil of me, that
I had bort the day before for a penny, he acshally sketched three
likenesses of me in his Book of the Songs, and giving it to me, said,
with his merry laugh. "There, I hope that will console you for my
bit of harmless fun;" and from what I was offered for my three
sketches when I showed 'em about, after he was gone, I thinks, that
upon the whole, I got a werry good share of the larf on my own side
of the mouth.</p>

<h2>AN IDEAL INTERVIEWER.</h2>

<h4><span class="sc">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>Den of latest Lion.</i></h4>

<p class="ind"><i>Latest Lion (perusing card with no visible signs of gratification.)</i>
Confound it! don't remember telling the Editor of <i>Park Lane</i> I'd
let myself be interviewed. Suppose I must have, though. (<i>Aloud
to</i> Servant, <i>who is waiting</i>.) You can show the Gentleman up.</p>

<p class="ind"><i>Servant (returning).</i> Mr. <span class="sc">Walsingham Jermyn</span>!</p>

<p class="ind1">[<i>A youthful Gentleman is shown in; he wears a pink-striped
shirt-front, an enormous button-hole, and a woolly frock-coat,
and is altogether most expensively and fashionably
attired, which, however, does not prevent him from appearing
somewhat out of countenance after taking a seat.</i></p>

<p class="ind"><i>The L. L. (encouragingly).</i> I presume, Mr. <span class="sc">Jermyn</span>, you're here
to ask me some questions about the future of the British East
African Company, and the duty of the Government in the matter?</p>

<p class="ind"><i>Mr. Jermyn (gratefully).</i> Er&mdash;yes, that's what I've come about,
don't you know&mdash;that sort of thing. Fact is (<i>with a burst of confidence</i>),
this isn't exactly my line&mdash;I've been rather let in for this.
You see, I've not been by way of doin' this long&mdash;but what's a
fellow to do when he's stony-broke? Got to do <i>somethin</i>', don't
you know. So I thought I'd go in for journalism&mdash;I don't mean
the drudgery of it, leader-writin' and that&mdash;but the light part of it,
<i>Society</i>, you know. But the other day, man who does the interviews
for <i>Park Lane</i> (that's the paper I'm on) jacked up all of a
sudden, and my Editor said I'd better take on his work for a bit,
and see what I made of it. I wasn't particular. You see, I've
always been rather a dead hand at drawin' fellows out, leadin' them
on, you know, and all that, so I knew it would come easy enough
to me, for all you've got to do is to sit tight and let the other chap&mdash;I
mean to say, the man you're interviewin'&mdash;do all the talking,
while you&mdash;I mean to say, myself&mdash;keep, keeps&mdash;hullo, I'm getting
my grammar a bit mixed; however, it don't signify&mdash;<i>I</i> keep quiet
and use my eyes and ears like blazes. Talking of grammar, I
thought when I first started that I should get in a regular hat over
the grammar, and the spellin', and that&mdash;<i>you</i> write, don't you,
when you're not travellin'? So you know what a grind it is to
spell right. But I soon found they kept a Johnny at the office with
nothing to do but put all your mistakes right for you, so, soon as I
knew that, I went ahead gaily.</p>

<p class="ind"><i>The L. L.</i> Exactly, and now, perhaps, you will let me know
what particular information you require?</p>

<p class="ind"><i>Mr. J.</i> Oh, <i>you</i> know the sort of thing the public likes&mdash;they'll
want to know what sort of diggings you've got, how you dress
when you're at home, and all that, how you write your books, now&mdash;you
do write books, don't you? Thought so. Well, that's what
the public likes. You see, your name's a good deal up just now&mdash;no
humbug, it <i>is</i> though! Between ourselves, you know, I think the
whole business is the balliest kind of rot, but they've got to have
it, so there you are, don't you see. I don't pretend to be a well-read
sort of fellow, never was particularly fond of readin' and that;
no time for it, and besides, I've always said <i>Books</i> don't teach you
knowledge of the world. I know the world fairly well&mdash;but I didn't
learn it from books&mdash;ah, you agree with me there&mdash;<i>you</i> know what
skittles all that talk is about education and that. Well, as I was
sayin', I don't read much, I see the <i>Field</i> every week, and a clinkin'
good paper it is, tells you everythin' worth knowin', and I read the
<i>Pink Un</i>, too. Do you know any of the fellows on it? Man I know
is a great friend of one of them, he's going to introduce me some
day, I like knowin' literary chaps, don't you? You've been about
a good deal, haven't you? I expect you must have seen a lot,
travellin' as you do. I've done a little travellin' myself, been
to Monte Carlo, you know, and the Channel Islands&mdash;<i>you</i> ever been
to the Channel Islands? Oh, you ought to go, it's a very cheery
place. Talkin' of Monte Carlo, I had a rattlin' good time at the
tables there; took out a hundred quid, determined I would have a
downright good flutter, and Jove! I made that hundred last me
over five days, and came away in nothing but my lawn-tennis
flannels. That's what I <i>call</i> a flutter, don't you know! Er&mdash;beastly
weather we're havin'! You have pretty good weather
where you've been? A young brother of mine has been out for a
year in Texas&mdash;he said <i>he</i>'d very good weather&mdash;of course that's
some way off where <i>you</i>'ve come from&mdash;Central Africa, isn't it?
Talkin' of my brother, what do you think the young ass did?&mdash;went
out there with a thousand pounds, and paid it all down to
some sportsmen who took him to see some stock they said belonged
to them&mdash;of course he found out after they'd off'd it that they
didn't own a white mouse among 'em! But then, <span class="sc">Dick's</span> one of
those chaps, you know, that think themselves so uncommon knowing,
they <i>can't</i> be had. I always told him he'd be taken in someday if
he let his tongue wag so much&mdash;too fond of hearing himself talk,
don't you know, great mistake for a young fellow; sure to say somethin'
you'd better have let alone. I suppose you're getting rather
sick of all these banquets, receptions, and that? They do you very
well, certainly. I went to one of these Company dinners some time
ago, and they did me as well as I've ever been done in my life,
but when you've got to sit still afterwards and listen to some chap
who's been somewhere and done somethin' jawin' about it by the
hour together without a check, why, it's not <i>good</i> enough, I'm
hanged if it is! Well, I'm afraid I can't stay any longer&mdash;my
time's valuable now, don't you know. I daresay yours is, too.
I'm awfully glad to have had a chat with you, and all that. I
expect you could tell me a lot more interesting things, only of course
you've got to keep the best of 'em to put in your book&mdash;you <i>are</i>
writin' a book or somethin', ain't you? Such heaps of fellows are
writin' books nowadays, the wonder is how any of 'em get read.
I shall try and get a look at yours, though, if I come across it anywhere;
hope you'll put some amusin' things in,&mdash;nigger stories and
that, don't make it too bally scientific, you know. Directly I get
back, I shall sit down, slick off, and write out all you've told me.
I shan't want any notes, I can carry it all in my head, and of
course I shan't put in anything you'd rather I didn't, don't you know.</p>

<p class="ind"><i>The L. L. (solemnly).</i> Mr. <span class="sc">Jermyn</span>, I place implicit confidence
in your discretion. I have no doubt whatever that your head, Sir,
is more than capable of containing such remarks as I have found
it necessary to make in the course of our interview. I like your
system of extracting information, Sir, very much. Good morning.</p>

<p class="ind"><i>Mr. Jermyn (outside).</i> Nice pleasant-spoken fellow&mdash;trifle long-winded,
though! Gad, I was so busy listenin' I forgot to notice
what his rooms were like or anythin'! How would it do to go back?
No, too much of a grind. Daresay I can manage to fox up somethin'.
I shall tell the Chief what he said about my system. Chief don't
quite know what I <i>can</i> do yet&mdash;this will open his eyes a bit.</p>
